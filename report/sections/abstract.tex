\chapter{Abstract}
With the rise of Deep Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a popular method for generating synthetic data. However, training GANs is challenging, particularly when dealing with large and privacy-sensitive datasets. This work provides an extensive analysis of training GANs in a distributed setting. It presents an open-source implementation that operates over networked environments while enhancing privacy by keeping data local.

This research was conducted for the "Distributed Deep Learning" and "Software Engineering" courses from the Swiss Joint Master of Science in Computer Science program.

The final product of our work is available on both of our GitHub profiles \url{https://github.com/darmangerd/distributed-gan} or \url{https://github.com/owengombas/distributed-gan} since we both equally contributed to the project.
